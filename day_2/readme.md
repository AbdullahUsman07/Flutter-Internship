# 📅 Day 2 – Theme Switching Functionality

## 🌟 Overview

On **Day 2**, I continued working on the UI design from Day 1 and implemented a **light theme**. Now, the user can seamlessly toggle between **dark and light modes** with a single click from the drawer in the Profile screen. This feature adds flexibility and improves accessibility for various lighting environments.

## ✅ Work Done Today

- Implemented **light theme** using `Provider` state management.
- Created a `ThemeProvider` class to manage and toggle themes.
- Added a **switch** inside the Profile screen drawer to change themes.
- Made sure all screens respond to theme changes:
  - Home screen
  - Menu section
  - Description section
  - Profile page
- Verified proper contrast and UI clarity for both light and dark themes.
