# ðŸš€ Day 4 â€“ Figma to Flutter UI Re| Page           | Page            | My 

## ðŸ“‹ Task Overview

Today's task was focused on **UI replication** using Flutter. I was assigned a Figma design and tasked to convert it into a working Flutter interface.

The goal was to **closely match the design** in layout, color scheme, typography, image placement, and overall styling.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

- Replicate the given Figma design into Flutter screens.
- Implement proper UI structure using `Column`, `Stack`, `Container`, `Text`, and `Image` widgets.
- Apply linear gradients, custom fonts, and image assets to match the theme.
- Ensure responsiveness and visual accuracy.
